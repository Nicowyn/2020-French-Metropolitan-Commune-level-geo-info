# 2020-French-Metropolitan-Commune-level-geo-info

This file contains all French communes. With an additional R script file, you can extract and retain only the metropolitan commune geographical information. Using the sf package and other tools, you can then process your dataset with coordinate variables to plot or intersect them.
